ASCII Designer
==============

Did you ever design a form by scribbling something like this in your editor::

        Text to transform:   [ Text_      ]
        
        Select transformation:
        
        (x) Uppercase
        ( ) Lowercase
        ( ) Title-case
        
            [ OK ]            [ Cancel ]

... and wished that you could be done with design and start coding? Well, look at this::

    from ascii_designer import AutoFrame

    class TextTransformer(AutoFrame):
        f_body='''
                                |    <->       |
            Text to transform:   [ Text_      ]
            
            Select transformation:
            
            (x) Uppercase
            ( ) Lowercase
            ( ) Title-case
            
                [ OK ]            [ Cancel ]~

        '''
        def ok(self):
            text = self.text
            if self.uppercase:
                text = text.upper()
            elif self.lowercase:
                text = text.lower()
            elif self.titlecase:
                text = text.title()
            print(text)
            self.close()
            
        def cancel(self):
            self.close()
            
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        TextTransformer().f_show()

You can find this very code in ``example.py``. Go ahead and try it!

Some comments, incidentally highlighting the features of this library:

  * As you probably guessed, all the magic happens in ``AutoFrame``. The 
    ``f_show`` call triggers rendering of the form. All the reserved attributes 
    are prepended with ``f_`` to get out of your way when subclassing.
  * There is a **well-defined syntax** for how to get the usual widget types. In the 
    example you can find labels (plain text), a text box, radio buttons and normal 
    buttons.
  * The columns are defined by the **header row** with the pipe characters. The 
    minus sign denotes stretching columns. (The ``<`` / ``>`` chars are just 
    decoration.)
  * **Column-span** is easily done by having not-a-space underneath the pipe 
    symbol. **Row-span** can also be done by prepending subsequent cells with a 
    ``{`` character.
  * **Anchoring** is controlled by whether the cell is space-padded or not. For 
    example, the Text box stretches, while the cancel button is centered. The 
    tilde character can be used instead of a fragile trailing space.
  * **Widget IDs** are automatically generated by lowercasing and whitelisting the 
    captions.
  * If a method exists with the same name as a widget id, it is **automatically 
    bound** to the usually-wanted event (click in case of button, value-changed in 
    case of basically anything else). Oh, and ``close`` and ``quit`` are already 
    there for your convenience.
  * Otherwise, you can retrieve and set the widget's value by using its id like
    a class **attribute**.
  * ``f_show()`` captures all the usual boilerplate and simply f***ing shows 
    the frame. It can be used for both the toplevel and additional frames.
  * Also note how the class name automatically turned into the window title. 
    Override by setting ``.f_title``.
  * The created widgets are **"raw", native widgets**. You can configure the toolkit 
    to use. Currently there is a Qt and a Tkinter implementation. The native 
    widget can accessed using ``form["widget_id"]`` (or 
    ``form.f_controls["widget_id"]``). 
    
The general philosophy is to not paint everything over with wrappers. Instead, 
the library focuses on specific tasks - building the layout, event-/value 
binding - and lets you do everything else with the API you know and (maybe) love.
    

INSTALLATION
------------

Requirements: Python >= 3, ``attrs``. Obviously, to use the Qt toolkit you need ``Pyqt4``.

Then::

    pip install https://github.com/loehnertj/ascii_designer/archive/master.zip
    
Or, download / clone and use ``python setup.py install``.
