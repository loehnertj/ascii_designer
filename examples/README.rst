Examples for ASCII Designer
===========================

The examples in this directory implement the `7GUIs challenges
<https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/>`. 7GUIs is a GUI programming "benchmark"
invented by Eugen Kiss. It defines seven tasks that represent typical challenges
in GUI programming. By design, the solutions to these tasks give very nice
examples of how to solve things in a certain environment.

The 7 tasks are:

1. Counter: a simple form that increments a counter value on button press.
2. Temperature converter: Bidirectional converter between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
3. Flight booker: travel- and return-date entry, shows interacting constraints.
4. Timer: Shows concurrency and crossthread communication.
5. CRUD: Exemplary database-table-editor form.
6. Circle Drawer\*: draws multiple circles, with Undo feature.
7. Spreadsheet\*: Basic spreadsheet application.

\*: Tasks 6 and 7 will probably be left out here, since ASCII Designer adds
nothing of value for solving these. (OTOH, there doesn't seem to be a
pure-python implementation so far, so I might change my mind sometime...)
